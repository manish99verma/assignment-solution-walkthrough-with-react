        "- SEO Challenges with SPAs:\n",
        "  * Content Loading with JavaScript: Search engines may not see all your content if it loads after the page is opened (client-side rendering).\n",
        "  * No Unique URLs for Pages: SPAs often don’t create separate URLs for each view, which makes it hard for Google to index all pages.\n",
        "  * Slow Initial Load Time: A big JavaScript bundle can delay the first content, which can hurt SEO rankings.\n",
        "  * Meta Tags Don't Update Properly: Title and meta description may not change when navigating inside the app.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Solutions:\n",
        "  * Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Render content on the server so search engines can read it directly.\n",
        "  * Use Prerendering for Static Content: Create static HTML for each route during build time for better indexing.\n",
        "  * Use Proper Routing: Use libraries like React Router with clean URLs (/about, /contact) to help indexing.\n",
        "  * Update Meta Tags Dynamically: Use tools like React Helmet or Vue Meta to change title and meta tags as you navigate.\n",

        "-\n",
        "Client-Side Rendering (CSR):\n",
        "  * The page is loaded with minimal HTML, and content is built using JavaScript in the browser.\n",
        "  * Slower initial load, but fast navigation once loaded.\n",
        "  * Not very SEO-friendly because content is loaded after the page loads.\n",
        "  * Best for apps that behave like software (e.g., dashboards).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Server-Side Rendering (SSR):\n",
        "    * The content is generated on the server and sent as full HTML to the browser.\n",
